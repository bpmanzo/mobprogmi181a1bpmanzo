            <b>Personal Background</b><br>
			Good day! My name is Brent Millen P. Manzo, 19 years old residing at Taguig City. I stayed there
with my family ever since I was born and had most of my experiences in that city. From pre-school to
junior high school, I went there for school and only just now for college, I went to another city which is
Makati.
          <br>

            <b>Personal Interests</b><br>
            To explore a new place is something I really want to do always. I get to meet new people and
make new friends. Most of my closest friends now come to the same college. Also, I was able to pursue
my passion for dance in this college after getting in the school&#39;s official dance varsity. From then, I
started participating in trainings inside and outside the team.
Over the summer, I had workshops and performed in a recital. The team also gave me the
chance to teach for the first time in an open class. It was a great summer experience for me as I was able
to improve in my passion and share what I know as well. It was fulfilling for me and I will certainly do it
again given the chance.
        </p>

            <b>Personal Experience</b><br>
Knowing that the subject title has something to do with design and user interface, I expect to
learn how to effectively make a design for programs that will allow me to efficiently make interactions
with users. I am really excited for what is up for us in this subject because this appeals as something new
for me in my chosen course.
